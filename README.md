# mool

This app was created back in September of 2019, when I had just completed a web dev bootcamp course on Udemy. It's a simple water tracking app that uses SVG, basic CSS styling, vanilla JavaScript, and jQuery. Users are able to set a daily intake goal (in oz or ml), and their progression towards this goal is visually displayed in the "teardrop" SVG, where amount-drank is calculated as a percentage of the goal.

I am currently working to recreate this app (mainly to improve its UI) and produce its second version with React.js. Stay tuned for mool-v2!
